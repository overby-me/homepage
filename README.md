# Homepage

Personal homepage for [overby.me](https://overby.me) — an interactive 3D graph visualization that maps out online presence, interests, and connections.

## Overview

The landing page renders a 3D force-directed graph (using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) via [react-force-graph-3d](https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph)) where nodes represent profiles, platforms, and life categories (Commerce, Improve, Connect, Immerse, Give). Clicking a node navigates to the corresponding URL.

Additional utility routes:

- `/search` — Redirects search queries to [Startpage](https://startpage.com)
- `/x` — Redirects X/Twitter links through [xcancel.com](https://xcancel.com)
- `/yt` — Embeds YouTube videos in a clean full-screen player
